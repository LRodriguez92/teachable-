          <p class='leftAlign'>Teachable is an online platform for
          instructors to build and sell courses on everything from
          iOS development and watercolor painting to magic tricks.
          With our revolutionary product, we've been able to pay out
          over $10M to our course creators... and we don't like to brag,
          but it hasn't been too shabby for us either!</p>

          <p class='rightAlign'>Over the past year, we've maintained a
          15-20% m-o-m growth rate, with a 7-figure run rate.  Oh - and
          we've raised $4.5M from a group of top venture investors.</p>

            We're a s,all, tight-knit team of intelligent self-starters who
            thrive on producing results with minimal management or meetings
            overhead.  We love to collaborate on the roadmap, design, and
            architecture of Teachable.

            And on any given day, you'll find us helping each other out around
            the office.  Basically, we're a bunch of friendly, happy Slack-addicts
            who love our jobs.
